## Description:
Welcome to the Hublab project repository! This innovative project is centered around integrating Pepper, a friendly humanoid robot, into the HUB-lab environment to serve as an interactive assistant for visitors. The HUB-lab, located within the HU library, is a dynamic space that offers access to cutting-edge technologies such as Virtual Reality, Robotics, Gamification, and Artificial Intelligence.

## Our mission is to enhance the visitor experience in two significant ways:

Human-Robot Interaction: We aim to explore and improve how visitors interact with technology, specifically through their engagement with Pepper. This component focuses on assessing participants' attitudes towards technology and refining Pepper's conversational abilities. By incorporating gestures and movements, we strive to make interactions not only more engaging but also more informative.
Technical Development: For those with a technical inclination, this aspect of the project involves enhancing Pepper's ability to understand and respond to visitor inquiries. We're exploring the integration of advanced AI solutions, including ChatGPT, to enable Pepper to provide accurate and helpful information about the lab's resources and how to utilize various technologies. This will be particularly beneficial in workshop settings, where Pepper can assist participants more effectively.
Project Goals:

- To make Pepper a knowledgeable and engaging assistant for visitors and workshop participants.
- To study and improve human-robot interactions within an educational and technological setting.
- To provide both less technical and technical students with hands-on experience in working with AI and robotics.
